# 🛠️ Helpdesk Ticket Analytics Dashboard (IT Support Project)

This project simulates a real-world **IT Support environment**, where a helpdesk team handles, tracks, and resolves service tickets across multiple departments. It demonstrates how **Power BI** can be used to monitor ticket trends, technician performance, and issue resolution efficiency—empowering IT teams to improve service delivery.

---

## 🧠 Goal

To turn helpdesk data into actionable insight through interactive dashboards for **real-time visibility**, smarter staffing, and faster resolution.

---

## 🎯 Use Case

IT teams in medium to large organizations receive dozens of service tickets daily. Without visibility into status, resolution time, and technician workload, it's hard to manage support performance effectively.

This dashboard enables:

- 📈 Real-time oversight of ticket volumes and trends  
- 🐢 Visibility into resolution delays and bottlenecks  
- 👨‍💻 Insight into technician workloads  
- 🏢 Departmental filtering and issue type breakdown  

This tool could be used by a **Service Desk Manager** to reduce backlogs, improve SLA compliance, and make smarter staffing decisions.
